My name is Wonik Jang, and I am currently surfing into 'deep learning' . As an extension of Industrial Engineering, I studied Statistics at Columbia University, where I worked on Machine Learning and Bayesian Statistics for choice model. After graduation, I worked as data RA at NYU for text mining and I am now in IT industry.

To share what I learned while 'deep learning' and remind them by myself, I started writing posts and code here. Most of the contents in this blog will be the way I undersood algorithms especially for Machine Learning and Deep Learning.  I enjoy traveling and I am currently in Korea. Please don't hesitate to contact me if there is any way that I can help. 

You can find the source code for my projects, deep learning, and bigdata
